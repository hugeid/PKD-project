{- transformGame event game
  handles input events from the user, depending on the game state if the user left-clicks
  GameOver -> the user is sent back to the starting screen.
  StartingScreen -> draws a game with a board size matching the button value the user clicked on.
  otherwise -> depending on the cell the user clicks on, the board is changed.
  independent of game state, right-clicking sends the user back to the starting screen.

  RETURNS: game updated with the result of event
